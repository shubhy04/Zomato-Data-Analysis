# Zomato Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the Zomato dataset to extract insights about restaurants, cuisines, pricing, ratings, and other related factors. The analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of the restaurant industry, customer preferences, and trends. The project was developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging various libraries for data analysis and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on restaurants, including:

- Restaurant name
- Cuisine type
- Location
- Average cost for two people
- User ratings
- Number of votes
- Online delivery status
- Reservation status

## Objective

The main objectives of this analysis are:

- To explore and understand the distribution of restaurants across different locations and cuisines.
- To analyze restaurant pricing and its relation to ratings and location.
- To find patterns and trends in user ratings and votes.
- To visualize the data for better understanding and interpretation.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used for this analysis:

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for coding and visualizing data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Key Analysis and Insights

1. **Location-Based Analysis**:
   - Distribution of restaurants across different locations.
   - Popular cuisines and restaurant types in each area.

2. **Cuisine and Pricing Analysis**:
   - Analysis of average prices per cuisine.
   - Relationship between cuisine type and restaurant ratings.

3. **Ratings and Votes**:
   - Distribution of ratings and votes across restaurants.
   - Identifying high-rated restaurants and factors influencing ratings.

4. **Online Delivery and Reservation**:
   - Restaurants offering online delivery and reservation services.
   - Analysis of how these factors influence ratings and popularity.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations, such as:

- Bar charts showing the number of restaurants per location.
- Heat maps for restaurant density.
- Scatter plots illustrating the relationship between ratings and prices.
- Histograms showing the distribution of average costs and user ratings.

## Installation

To run the project, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the libraries using the following commands:

`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy jupyter`

Then, open the Jupyter Notebook using:

`jupyter notebook Zomato-Data-Analysis.ipynb`

## Usage

Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis step by step. Each section of the notebook is organized to guide you through the data cleaning, exploration, and visualization processes.

## Conclusion

The Zomato Data Analysis project provides insights into the restaurant landscape and customer preferences. It helps to identify trends in pricing, cuisine popularity, and user ratings, which can be valuable for restaurant owners, food enthusiasts, and business analysts.

## Future Work

- Expanding the dataset to include more cities and time series data.
- Developing a predictive model to forecast restaurant ratings based on various factors.
- Incorporating machine learning algorithms for deeper insights.
